> Reference [guide](https://harmony.cs.cornell.edu/docs/textbook/install/)

Harmony is installed via python pip.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Errors we've found during installation might be fixed with installing development tools for python.

```bash
apt install python3-dev
```
